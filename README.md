# OPSChallenges

Below are challenges I have completed during Ops 201. These challenges all dealt with scripting, either a shell, batch, or bash. As we all know when we first learn any type of computer language the first thing you learn is to print "Hello, World" which was challenge 1, hence you don't see a challenge 1 here. Other than that, feel free to browse around.
