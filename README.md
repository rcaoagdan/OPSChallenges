# OPSChallenges

Below are challenges I have completed during Ops 201. These challenges all dealt with scripting, either a shell, batch, or bash. As we all know when we first learn any type of computer language the first thing you learn is to print "Hello, World" which was challenge 1, hence you don't see a challenge 1 here. All these basic scripting are essential in learning basic commands either via linux or command prompt/ powershell. I learned java, C+ a while back, so having knowledge from that helped me a lot understanding concepts of scripting, and how to structure them nicely. My favorite challenge would have to be the final challenge. IT had been a while since I wrote a bash script, so going back to it was a fun trip. As I continue on in my learning these scripts will change as my skillsets improve.
